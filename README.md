### **Example Workflow**
```python
# User Registration
POST /register
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com", 
    "password": "SecurePass123!"
}

# Price Prediction Access
GET /predicted
# Returns products with ML-generated price predictions

# Review Submission
POST /add_review
{
    "product_id": "prod_1",
    "rating": 5,
    "comment": "Excellent product quality!"
}
```

## Machine Learning Model

### **Algorithm Details**
- **Model Type**: Random Forest Regressor with 200 estimators
- **Feature Engineering**: Seasonal factors, market demand, original pricing
- **Category Optimization**: Specialized models for different product categories
- **Prediction Range**: Controlled output within 80%-150% of original price

### **Training Process**
```python
# Category-specific model training
for category in df["category"].unique():
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, random_state=42)
    X_train = [price, seasonal_factor, market_demand]
    y_train = predicted_price
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### **Performance Metrics**
| Category | Seasonal Variance | Demand Impact | Prediction Accuracy |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Electronics | Minimal (¬±2%) | Low (¬±5%) | High Stability |
| Fashion | High (¬±30%) | Moderate (¬±25%) | Dynamic Pricing |
| Luxury | Low (¬±5%) | Minimal (¬±10%) | Premium Stability |

## Database Schema

### **User Model**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL
);
```

### **Review Model**
```sql
CREATE TABLE review (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY,
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL,
    comment TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
